# JS Numeric Keypad
A simple Javascript numeric keypad

We had a client at [RITH](http://rith.co.uk) that required a simple JS keypad for use on a device that had no physical/soft keypad. Every existing keypad library that I found used jQuery, which was not possible in this project, so this was my solution.
